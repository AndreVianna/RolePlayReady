Working on RolePlayReady, a solution with multiple projects for a tabletop roleplaying toolset. Consists of Blazor frontend, server-side API, domain logic, data access layer, and Core for general code. Uses FluentValidation, Serilog, Xunit, NSubstitute, FluentAssertions. Repository pattern for data access. Projects have corresponding unit tests.
The GitHub repo has been created, and the initial solution and projects were set up in a local Source folder. The projects were created using dotnet CLI commands, and the changes have been committed to the GitHub repo.


I want AutoGPT to help me analyse, debug, and improve an existing .NET 7 C# Web API, using the best practices, including DRY, KISS, SOLID, SOC, design patterns, clean code/architecture, DDD, clarity, maintainability; testability. The API is located in "https://github.com/AndreVianna/RolePlayReady". At this moment I need AutoGpt to retrive the project and make a thorought assessment of its content and prepare everything to continue the development in future commands. Github username/password authentication for github is disable. Pease see https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls for information on currently recommended modes of authentication.
