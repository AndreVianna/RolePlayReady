Working on RolePlayReady, a solution with multiple projects for a tabletop roleplaying toolset. Consists of Blazor frontend, server-side API, domain logic, data access layer, and Core for general code. Uses FluentValidation, Serilog, Xunit, NSubstitute, FluentAssertions. Repository pattern for data access. Projects have corresponding unit tests.
The GitHub repo has been created, and the initial solution and projects were set up in a local Source folder. The projects were created using dotnet CLI commands, and the changes have been committed to the GitHub repo.
